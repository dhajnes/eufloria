# Eufloria v.2
Eufloria is a project for automatic irrigation and sensing of the state of home-grown plants.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to experience the hands-on development process ranging from the code running on arduino and the MCU for wifi, through mobile application design for checking on how are your plants doing, automatic control of the irrigation based on the surrounding conditions to designing and soldering the actual circuit and possibly designing the actual PCB with the mounted chipset.
