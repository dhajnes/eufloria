# Eufloria v.2
Eufloria is a project for automatic irrigation and sensing of the state of home-grown plants.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to experience the hands-on development process ranging from the code running on arduino and the MCU for wifi, through mobile application design for checking on how are your plants doing, automatic control of the irrigation based on the surrounding conditions to designing and soldering the actual circuit and possibly designing the actual PCB with the mounted chipset.

## What has been done yet.
The result of the first version can be seen in the following video:

The first version was running on STM32 chip, which was really limited input/output wise. In this version an interconnection between an Arduino and an MCU Wi-Fi module is planned.
Scheme can be seen here:
